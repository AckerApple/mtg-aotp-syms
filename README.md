## Goals

The aim of this project is to generate scalable and customizable symbols for Magic The Gathering's Arena of the Planeswalkers with very little HTML and that is also familiar to that of the [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) syntax.

For instance, generating an ability text with attack and/or defense symbols only requires the following HTML

    Character has +1<i class="aotp aotp-attack"></i> and +1<i class="aotp aotp-defense"></i>

And a squad symbol is

    <i class="aotp aotp-squad"></i>


## How to modify the font

This project currently uses [glyphter.com](https://glyphter.com/) to create the fonts from SVG files.


## Credit

- I asked this [guy](https://github.com/AlexandreArpin) to add AOTP symbols to his [mtg-font](https://github.com/AlexandreArpin/mtg-font) repository and he, with good reason, told me I should go make it myself. Thank you [Alexandre Arpin](https://github.com/AlexandreArpin), I just needed a little encouragement.

- A special thanks to those who've kept mtg going in a respectable fashion, much respect. Great job expanding the brand and crossing it over it a well done fashion into Arena of the Planeswalkers.

- Much credit goes to anyone apart of making web standards, or anyone adopting them, or even anyone apart of github like public code repos where we all move along together by sharing in this public format (instead of tooling in the dark on a self made to be copy written "master piece").

- Always an extra special thanks to my wife Shelby, for anytime I skipped a chore so that I could tool around with my hobbies. La u.
