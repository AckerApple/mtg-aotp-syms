# mtg-aotp-syms
An iconic font and CSS toolkit for Magic The Gathering's Arena of the Planeswalkers

Looking for mtg original symbols? [tap here](https://github.com/AlexandreArpin/mtg-font)

## Goals

The aim of this project is to generate scalable and customizable symbols for Magic The Gathering's Arena of the Planeswalkers with very little HTML and that is also familiar to that of the [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) syntax.

For instance, generating an ability text with attack and/or defense symbols only requires the following HTML

    Character has +1<i class="aotp aotp-attack"></i> and +1<i class="aotp aotp-defense"></i>

And a squad symbol is

    <i class="aotp aotp-squad"></i>


## How to modify the font

This project currently uses [glyphter.com](https://glyphter.com/) to create the fonts from SVG files.


## Credit
- I asked this [guy](https://github.com/AlexandreArpin) to add AOTP symbols to his mtg font repository and he, with good reason, told me I should go make it myself. Thank you [Alexandre Arpin](https://github.com/AlexandreArpin), I just needed a little encouragement.
